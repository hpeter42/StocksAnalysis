Performing Analysis on Financial Data to uncover trends about stocks

## Overview
Initially, Steve began analyzing the “DQ” ticker for his parents investment portfolio. However, Steve thought it would be best to try to diversify his parents’ portfolio. In this analysis, my goal is to use VBA scripting to create an efficient analytic workbook, which will in turn make it possible for Steve to calculate and analyze data for numerous stocks. To do so, I added a ticker volume array, a ticker starting price array, and a ticker ending price array to store data required for the analysis by ticker. I was able to retrieve the data, and then I used it to determine some helpful metrics. Lastly, the program displayed the data in a way that was easy to read.

## Results
In 2017, most of the stocks of each ticker had a really good return on investment. “DQ” had a 200% return on investment, which is the one that Steve’s parents wanted to invest in. If Steve’s parents invested all their money in “DQ”, they would have maximized the amount of money they would have made in 2017. However, “DQ” dropped in 2018 by 62.6%. It would be wiser for Steve’s parents to invest their money in “RUN” and “ENPH,” because those two stocks have consistent positive returns in both 2017 and 2018.

## Summary
The advantages to refactoring code are that you can make programs run more quickly and take less processing power. The disadvantage to refactoring code is that it take time spent reanalyzing code that could be spent on writing other programs or analyzing results from programs.
